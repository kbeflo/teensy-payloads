You will also need [Teensyduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino.html). The PJRC website has a [very easy to use guide](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/first_use.html) on getting Teensyduino setup.

## Usage

## PaensyLib By Ozuru

Once Teensyduino is installed and working, place the PaensyLib folder inside your Arduino\libraries. Arduino is installed in your Program Files (x86 if 64 bit) directory by default. To utilize Paensy, simply include the library in your code:

    #include <paensy.h>
